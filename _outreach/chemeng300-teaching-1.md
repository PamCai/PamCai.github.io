Teaching Assistant
======

I was a teaching assistant (TA) for the graduate level applied math course (<i>Applied Mathematics in the Chemical and Biological Sciences</i>) in Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. This course was taught by Professor Andrew Spakowitz at Stanford University. The course was a survey of mathematical tools that would be useful for chemical and biological engineers, including but not limited to Einstein notation, ordinary and partial differential equations, statistical methods, Laplace and Fourier transforms, and linear response functions.
