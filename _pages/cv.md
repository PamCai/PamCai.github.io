* 2019 **Stanford Bio-X Interdisciplinary Graduate Research Fellowship**

## Research

**Spakowitz + Heilshorn Labs**
:   <i>**Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering**</i>
:   **Stanford University**
:   <i>Ph.D. Candidate (Mar 2019 - Jun 2023)</i>
:   My doctoral training focused on deriving polymer physics theory and applying theoretical frameworks towards the design and understanding of biological materials. I collaborated with researchers across Stanford's Schools of Engineering and Medicine as well as at the University of Notre Dame. 

**Tisdale Lab**
:   <i>**Department of Chemical Engineering**</i>
:   **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**
:   <i>Undergraduate Researcher (Oct 2015 - Jun 2016)</i>
:   In the laboratory of Professor Will Tisdale, I worked on the synthesis of Cd/Se nanoplatelets to optimize uniformity of size distribution for nanoelectronic applications and performed the associated characterization of these materials. 

**Doyle Lab**
:   <i>**Department of Chemical Engineering**</i>
:   **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**
:   <i>Undergraduate Researcher (Oct 2012 - May 2014)</i>
:   Under the guidance of Dr. Rathi Srinivas (Ph.D. student in Professor Pat Doyle's lab), I optimized the sensitivity and specificity of a high-throughput hydrogel microparticle microfluidic platform for protein detection and quantification. I used the platform to quantify protein secretion in four biological fluids derived from mice to understand dysregulation in lung cancer.
