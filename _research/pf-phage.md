Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a common experimental technique used to determine the diffusion coefficient of a molecule through a medium. The most prevalent modeling used to determine this diffusion coefficient is phenomenological, often assuming that the recovery curve takes the form of an exponential function and using values such as the mobile or immobile fraction and time it takes to reach half the maximum intensity to describe the diffusion. While one can still extract useful information from this type of analysis, the effective diffusion coefficient from fitting an exponential to the data does not reveal deeper information about the mechanisms leading to the diffusion patterns observed. We propose a newly derived model that allows more mechanistic understanding of the diffusion observed as the fluorescence recovers. The model accounts for potential binding of the molecule to either one or two separate entities in the medium that can alter the diffusion of the molecule, generating 2-state and 3-state models. Though previous models have also incorporated binding effects, our model is a simpler method to derive the fluorescent recovery in such cases and provides a framework that can be extended to even more scenarios of binding events. Applying these models to more complex FRAP experiments will lead to greater information gained per experiment. Lastly, we leverage these models to support the hypothesis that positively-charged antibiotics can be sequestered by sputum biopolymers and bacteriophage.
